# About JustInvest

Just Invest is a long-term project that stems from personal passion for finance. For the first major version, the package is going to be a refactorized version of my previous project on [asset allocation](https://github.com/ianyu93/asset-allocation-system). The refactorized system allows one to easily switch up prediction strategy.
